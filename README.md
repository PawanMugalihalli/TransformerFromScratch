Transformer Network Implementation from Scratch (PyTorch)
This repository contains an implementation of the Transformer architecture from scratch, inspired by the paper "Attention Is All You Need", using PyTorch. The model is built to perform sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as translation or text generation.

Key Features
Self-attention mechanism: Efficiently computes relationships between tokens in a sequence.
Positional encoding: Adds position information to the input embeddings to account for token order.
Encoder-decoder architecture: Uses multiple layers of encoder and decoder blocks for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
Multi-head attention: Allows the model to attend to different parts of the sequence simultaneously, improving learning of complex patterns.
Masking: Implements masking to prevent attention to certain tokens, useful for tasks like sequence generation.
Model Details
Number of layers: 6
Number of attention heads: 8
Embedding size: 512
Dropout rate: 0
Forward expansion: 4 (for the feed-forward layers)
Requirements
Python 3.7+
PyTorch 1.8+
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization, if needed)
